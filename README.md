## spinploy

Lightweight HTTP API for Azure DevOps to create and manage PR preview deployments on Dokploy. It exposes simple endpoints designed for use from pipelines and service hooks with a minimal Dokploy client.

### Status

Early work-in-progress. Current server provides a health check and preview endpoints plus Azure DevOps webhooks.

### Quick start

```bash
# Configure (env vars or .env.local at repo root)
export DOKPLOY_URL=https://dokploy.example.com

# Dokploy environment and git settings
export PROJECT_ID=your_dokploy_project_id
export ENVIRONMENT_ID=your_dokploy_environment_id
export CUSTOM_GIT_URL=ssh://git@example.com/your/repo.git
export CUSTOM_GIT_SSH_KEY_ID=ssh_key_id_in_dokploy
export COMPOSE_PATH=./docker-compose.yml
export BASE_DOMAIN=preview.example.com
export FRONTEND_SERVICE_NAME=web
export FRONTEND_PORT=3000
export BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME=api
export BACKEND_PORT=8080

# Azure DevOps (for posting PR thread replies)
export AZDO_ORG=your_org
export AZDO_PROJECT=your_project
export AZDO_REPOSITORY_ID=00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000
export AZDO_PAT=your_pat_with_code_write

# Optional
export BIND_ADDR=0.0.0.0:8080
export RUST_LOG=debug

# Run
cargo run
```

You can also place these in a `.env.local` at the repo root (loaded in debug builds).

### Authentication

All API endpoints (except `/healthz`) require an API key on each request. Provide either:

- `x-api-key: <DOKPLOY_API_KEY>` header, or
- HTTP Basic auth with the API key as the password (username can be empty).

This API key must be a Dokploy API key with permissions for the target project/environment.

### Configuration

- DOKPLOY_URL: Base URL of your Dokploy instance
- PROJECT_ID: Dokploy project ID
- ENVIRONMENT_ID: Dokploy environment ID
- CUSTOM_GIT_URL: Git URL Dokploy should pull from
- CUSTOM_GIT_SSH_KEY_ID: Dokploy SSH key ID to use for the repo
- COMPOSE_PATH: Path to your compose file within the repo
- BASE_DOMAIN: Base domain used to mint preview subdomains
- FRONTEND_SERVICE_NAME: Compose service name for the frontend
- FRONTEND_PORT: Service port exposed for the frontend
- BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME: Compose service name for the backend
- BACKEND_PORT: Service port exposed for the backend
- AZDO_ORG: Azure DevOps organization
- AZDO_PROJECT: Azure DevOps project
- AZDO_REPOSITORY_ID: Azure DevOps repository ID
- AZDO_PAT: Azure DevOps Personal Access Token (Code Write to post comments)
- BIND_ADDR (optional): Server bind address (default `0.0.0.0:8080`)
- RUST_LOG (optional): Tracing filter (defaults internally to `debug,axum=info,reqwest=info,hyper_util=info`)

#### Optional: Protected static storage

If you want the API to also serve static files (like a simple storage bucket) behind a header-based token, set:

- `STORAGE_DIR`: Absolute path to the directory to serve
- `STORAGE_TOKEN`: Shared secret token clients must send in the `x-storage-token` header

When configured, files are available under `/storage/*`. Requests must include:

```
x-storage-token: <STORAGE_TOKEN>
```

Example request:

```bash
curl -H "x-storage-token: $STORAGE_TOKEN" \
     https://your-spinploy.example.com/storage/path/to/file.txt -o file.txt
```

### API

- GET `/healthz` — service health probe
- POST `/previews` — create or update a preview environment
  - Request (JSON): `{ "gitBranch": "feature/foo", "prId": "123" }` (`prId` optional)
  - Response (200 JSON): `{ "composeId": "...", "domains": ["host1", "host2"] }`
- DELETE `/previews` — delete a preview environment
  - Request (JSON): `{ "gitBranch": "feature/foo", "prId": "123" }`
  - Response: 204 No Content
- POST `/webhooks/azure/pr-comment` — handle PR comment slash commands (`/preview`, `/delete`)
  - `/preview`: creates/updates preview and replies with the frontend URL
  - `/delete`: deletes preview and replies "Preview deleted"
- POST `/webhooks/azure/pr-updated` —
  - Push: redeploy existing preview if present (204 if none)
  - Status change to `completed`: if target branch is `main`, delete preview

All API calls must include the API key as described in Authentication.

When storage is enabled, static files are served at `GET /storage/*` and require the `x-storage-token` header.

### Docker volume example

Mount a host directory and expose it via `/storage/*`:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 \
  -e DOKPLOY_URL=... \
  -e PROJECT_ID=... \
  -e ENVIRONMENT_ID=... \
  -e CUSTOM_GIT_URL=... \
  -e CUSTOM_GIT_SSH_KEY_ID=... \
  -e COMPOSE_PATH=./docker-compose.yml \
  -e BASE_DOMAIN=preview.example.com \
  -e FRONTEND_SERVICE_NAME=web \
  -e FRONTEND_PORT=3000 \
  -e BACKEND_SERVICE_NAME=api \
  -e BACKEND_PORT=8080 \
  -e AZDO_ORG=... -e AZDO_PROJECT=... -e AZDO_REPOSITORY_ID=... -e AZDO_PAT=... \
  -e STORAGE_DIR=/data/storage -e STORAGE_TOKEN=supersecret \
  -v /absolute/path/on/host:/data/storage:ro \
  your/spinploy:latest
```

### Azure DevOps usage

Add a lightweight step in your pipeline to create/update a preview on each PR build:

```yaml
- task: Bash@3
  displayName: Create/Update preview
  env:
    PREVIEW_API: https://your-spinploy.example.com
    DOKPLOY_API_KEY: $(DOKPLOY_API_KEY)
  script: |
    curl -sS -X POST "$PREVIEW_API/previews" \
      -H "x-api-key: $DOKPLOY_API_KEY" \
      -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      -d '{
            "gitBranch": "$(Build.SourceBranchName)",
            "prId": "$(System.PullRequest.PullRequestNumber)"
          }'
```

Service hooks:

- Pull request commented on: send to `/webhooks/azure/pr-comment`.
  - Authentication: include `x-api-key` header (or Basic with password-only) with your Dokploy API key
  - Slash commands handled in the same PR thread:
    - `/preview`: creates/updates preview and replies with the frontend URL
    - `/delete`: deletes preview and replies "Preview deleted"
- Pull request updated — create two subscriptions, both to `/webhooks/azure/pr-updated`:
  - Settings: `notificationType = PushNotification` — Redeploy existing preview if present (204 if none)
  - Settings: `notificationType = StatusUpdateNotification` — On status change to `completed`, delete preview (only when target branch is `main`)
